# About the project

The project is part of the Modular course for C++ at Vilnius University.

It's a video game... I'm not the lore master...

# Inspirations and assets

The game code is heavily inspired by [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQzAHcojEKg&list=PLhfAbcv9cehhkG7ZQK0nfIGJC_C-wSLrx&index=1&ab_channel=Let%27sMakeGames) from the "Let's Make Games" youtube channel.

All assets were either made by hand or taken from free online resources. Feel free to use them as you wish <3
